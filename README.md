This project was made to backtest the "candlesticks patterns", often mentionned in financial technical analysis.

As data input, i used the EURUSD trading data 1 minute resolution and transformed it in order to test the patterns over many timeframe.

### Result
**I wasn't able to find any patterns that would, used alone, make any benefit as a trading strategy.**
